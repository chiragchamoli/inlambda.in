I am building a new unsocial link-aggregation/discussion site similar to Hacker News, Reddit, and Slashdot, and borrows some ideas while also attempting to fixing some problems specific to each site. 

> The site will never be monitized ever. 

1. Membership: The site will be opened for fist 50 members. After the registeration will be closed.
2. After 50 members, the site will become invite only to control the inflow and conversations. 
3. We will have one strike policiy against spam.
4. [Open for debate] I am not sure if we should have upvote/downvote for everthing or just upvote
5. Semi Annon Community, you can choose to be annon. 
  ```bash
		  New User 

		  Username ____________
		  Password ____________
		  Email    ____________ 
      Email will be used only in case you loose your password, and nothing else. Others can't see this.
	```	  

6. Private Messages: Users can send messages to each other without having to disclose an e-mail address.
7. Transparency, admins will be able to ban users, with explaniation, so next time a user login will be in read only mode but on his profile page we can see why was this account banned.
8. Tags: In hacker news specially, it is very hard to see if I need to read a story with no meta information avilable.
9. Comments: There are many ideas here
      1. You'll be able to use @user from the comment box, simillar to the Github but just for that thread.
      2. Silent voting for Comments
   
10. Easy embeding of source code via Gist or Special Tags.
